# DIY Lingo 

DIY Lingo is a platform that allows its users to create language learning courses and course practice tests. I created this prototype to allow me to practice my development skills, and pad up my github repro. The project uses CodeIgniter, JavaScript, VueJS, and MySQL.

### Demo 

Video coming soon...

### Current third party libraries

* [Ion Auth](https://github.com/benedmunds/CodeIgniter-Ion-Auth) (includes Bcrypt as a dependency)
* [ParseDown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown) 
* [VueJS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) 
* [SVG flag icons](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css)

### To do 

There are still some standard SQL queries that need converting to use the CodeIgniter query class.
